It's lap 8 of 12 at Spa. Light rain has started. The leader ahead just stayed out on slicks. The car behind boxed two laps ago for inters and is setting purple sectors. Your tyres have four laps of grip left. Your pit window closes in three. The board on the pit wall is asking what to call.

That's the world we built for the **Meta PyTorch OpenEnv Hackathon Grand Finale**. F1 Strategist is an OpenEnv environment for training LLM agents on real Formula 1 race-strategy decisions. The model doesn't drive the car — a built-in physics simulator handles laps, tyres, fuel, and opponents. The model is the **race engineer** making strategic calls.

## Why F1 strategy is a good RL benchmark

Three things matter for a long-horizon LLM environment, and race strategy hits all three:

- **Verifiable but not scriptable.** Final position, FIA compound rules, fuel margin — all programmable Python checks. No LLM judge in the reward path. But the optimal sequence depends on hidden state (opponent stint plans, weather evolution, true tyre degradation) that the agent must investigate before deciding.
- **Genuinely long-horizon.** A 12-lap sprint is 12 strategic decision points across 25 minutes of simulated race time. A wrong call at lap 4 only manifests in lap 9. This is the failure mode current LLMs handle worst — and it's exactly what Theme #2 of the hackathon asks for.
- **Multi-objective without being subjective.** Six independent reward dimensions (race result, tyre management, fuel discipline, strategic timing, comms quality, operational efficiency) combine into a single weighted scalar. The model trains against a stable signal; judges read a coherent breakdown.

## The environment

Each episode is one race. Each step is one lap. The agent sees the current race state (positions, weather, tyres, fuel, opponents within TV-feed visibility) and emits one of ~20 strategic commands:

```
PIT_NOW <soft|medium|hard|inter|wet>
SET_MODE <push|race|conserve|fuel_save|tyre_save>
DEFEND_POSITION  /  ATTACK_AHEAD  /  HOLD_GAP <n>
INSPECT_TYRE_DEGRADATION
CHECK_OPPONENT_STRATEGY <n>
REQUEST_FORECAST
ASSESS_UNDERCUT_WINDOW
RADIO_DRIVER "<message>"
DONE
```

The signature primitive is **hidden state revealed by inspection**. Each episode has a true tyre wear curve, opponent stint plans, a pre-rolled weather schedule, and a pre-rolled safety-car schedule. None of it is in the observation by default. The agent investigates by issuing inspection commands, each of which pays a small `+0.02` shaping reward the first time it returns new information.

This forces the agent to *plan* — not just react. We saw this work in our Round-1 OpsTwin submission and we ported the entire architectural pattern into the F1 domain.

## The training story

We trained Qwen3-4B with TRL GRPO on a single RTX 5090 over 500 steps. The setup:

- Stage 1: SFT warm-start on rule-based expert trajectories
- Stage 2: GRPO with shaped per-step rewards
- Stage 3: GRPO with sparse final-only rewards (long-horizon polish)

The trained policy beats the untrained baseline by ~30 average score points across our four scenario families. The single most-vivid example is the **weather roulette** scenario at Spa: the untrained agent stays out into the rain and finishes P9 with a 0.30 score. Same seed, same opponents, the trained agent calls `REQUEST_FORECAST` at lap 5, sees the rain cone, calls `INSPECT_TYRE_DEGRADATION`, then pits one lap before the rain peak. P2 finish, 0.91 score.

## The self-improvement loop

After each episode, the env classifies the failure (missed undercut, late weather call, fuel underburn, panic pit, ...) and writes a structured postmortem to a JSONL file. On the next reset for the same scenario family, the top-2 lowest-scoring past postmortems are injected into the initial observation as memory hints:

```
[MEMORY] Last similar incident: late_weather_call.
First bad action: STAY_OUT lap 7. Missed signal: REQUEST_FORECAST not called.
Preferred order: REQUEST_FORECAST → INSPECT_TYRE_DEGRADATION → PIT_NOW inter.
```

Memory-augmented evaluation showed an additional ~0.07 average improvement over the base trained policy — the agent learns from its own failures across episodes without any embedding store or vector database.
